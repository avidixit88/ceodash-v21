"""Strategic relevance engine v0.9.2.

This engine converts incoming or curated signals into Michael/NextCure-specific
intelligence. It is deliberately source-agnostic: today it can score curated seed
signals; later the same contract can accept patents, grants, abstracts, PRs, SEC
filings, or clinical-trial updates.
